# LifeTimePaws

LifeTimePaws is a centralized platform for publicizing animals that need urgent adoptions from shelters across the country. LTP provides a way for a shelter to gain more site traffic outside their local region, increasing potential adoption chances for animals who don't have much time left in the shelter.
